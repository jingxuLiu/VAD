### VAD

This repository provides the official PyTorch implementation of VAD: Visual-Affective Decoding Enhances Neurofunctional Objective and Generalizable Signatures in Unseen Adolescent Depression Diagnosis. Please refer to our paper for detailed methodology and evaluation.

We provide the training script train_vad.py and the inference script infer_vad.py in this repository. Other components, including data preprocessing scripts, model implementation files, and downstream task code, will be made publicly available after this paper is accepted.

### Installation

```python
conda create -n vad python==3.11.10
conda activate vad
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
